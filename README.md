Problem Statement
Detecting humans in environments filled with smoke is a critical challenge during firefighting and emergency response operations. Traditional vision systems struggle to identify people in such conditions due to the obscured visibility. This project aims to address this issue by developing a robust detection system that can accurately identify people in smoke-filled rooms.
